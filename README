Calendar Watchface for Pebble

This is a Watchface for the Pebble Watch.  It shows the current date and current time in the top half, and then a small calendar w/ 3 weeks: last, current, and next week, in the bottom half.

This is a work in progress: it will eventually support a configuration screen on the phone to set styles.
