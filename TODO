TODOS:

Watchface
 - vibration option(s)
  - respect DND period (when exposed in SDK)
  - hourly vibrations period (e.g. 9am - 5pm?)
  New Features
    - hide statusbar and reposition slots (or repurpose the statusbar for other information) when:
      - battery > X% (user defined)
      - link is good
      - not charging
    - display notice if there's a newer version available?
    - seconds display
      - horizontal bar for seconds?
    - Alarm
    - Charge history
      - track battery/charging events in javascript local storage, plot over time w/ history on config page
    - Accelerometer
      - Accelerometer detection for 'swapping slots'
        - slot: Weather
        - slot: 2nd Timezone clock
        - slot: Barcode(s) (if big enough to scan?)
        - slot: 2 factor authenticator
        - slot: moon phases
        - slot: geolocation (geocaching, etc.)
        - Configuration for which slots are visible under what conditions
      - Idle timer - reminder to stay active, configure inactivity period + vibe + sensitivity
        - Sleep tracking?  (extension of idle tracking, requires LOTS of work)
  - better free unicode font
    - using unifont
      - http://www.czyborra.com/unifont/ / http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html
      - nice and small, but @ 14 there are some glyph artifacts/errors, it was designed for 8x16/16x16
    - Deja Vu Sans Mono...
      - http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download
      - too big...

HTML configuration page
  - Android has issues with the radio groups, may need to use selects, or have everything vertical
  - embedded rather than hosted?  e.g. https://github.com/bertfreudenberg/PebbleONE/blob/master/wscript
    - not a great idea, with current IOS restrictions...
  - version clearly displayed @ top of config page
    - display notice if there's a newer version available?
